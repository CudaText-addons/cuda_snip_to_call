Plugin for CudaText.
Gives the new way for calling commands (internal in CudaText, and external from plugins, e.g. ExtTools or Macros).

Adds one item to Plugins menu: "Configure SnipToCall".
Assign snip-strings to some commands, e.g. "pu" for "caret page up". Then you can type in any text "/pu" and press Tab. Snip-string will be removed, and assigned command will run. Between "/" and snip-string the number allowed, it is repeat-counter. So "/5pu" will do 5 page-ups.

Also plugin "Configure Hotkeys" is changed, in it you can also see and change snip-strings.
